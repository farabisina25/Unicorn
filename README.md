Bilkent University CS102 Project - Unicorn


An application that identifies students in a school with a high similarity ratio based on similar char-acteristics and interests, enables them to communicate and suggests that they can stay in the same dormitory room.
These characteristics are early-late bedtime, playing musical instruments, smok-ing or not, sleeping with the light on and off, being in the same department, liking to study in the room, having similar music tastes, having similar concert-theater-match-game tastes, liking to cook or not liking, etc. 
People with similar activity tastes can also go to events organized throughout the city or organized at school with students whom they have matched with in the room search app but have not gone out to the same room. 
In other words, there are a lot of similarities, but people who do not go out in the same room because they do not agree on something can add each others as a friend and communicate. 
At the same time, a student can also add used school books that he/she sells to his/her profile.
All the necessary data is stored in the cloud, and the application's inner workings rely on the classes
The mobile application independently retrieves relevant information such as programmed flow, profiles, books, and the activities directly from the cloud.
